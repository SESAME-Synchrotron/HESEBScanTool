Collect your experimental data
==================================

Currently, to take a copy of your data you can ask the beamline scientist to do so. On the other hand, we are working on global solution for accessing and collecting the users experimental data. The solutions are: 

* SESAME Experimental Data Dispenser (SEDD): which an onsite service that allow users to login into specific SEDD computers using their SESAME Users’ Portal (SUP) account and then the user’s data will be automatically mounted on the user home directory making it available for copying and analysis.
